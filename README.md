# The Go Programming Language

Exercises from the book

I started these exercises at the beginning of 2019, made it to 4.11 then
stopped. I picked it back up in Feb 2020 starting from 4.12, I'll go back and
redo the older ones once I've reached the end of the book.

## Format

The top level directories are for each chapter and in each directory there will
be directories for each exercise, e.g. `ch1/1.1/`

Where possible I have written the exercise in a comment just above the `main`
function using the `/* */` format. If there is no `main` package then I'll have
put it in the package for the exercise somewhere, just have a look around.
